## Description
All the switches do something different:
- S1: Interchanges between leds, that is, if green is on, turns it off and
turns red on, and the other way around, turns red off and green on.
- S2: Dims the leds going from bright green to off, red off to bright and then
off again, and turn green bright again.
- S3: Turns green off, red on and plays a simple melody.
- S4: Almost the same like S1, but with the buzzer. Green plays a low note and
red a higher note.
